WEEK 2 CLEANING PLAN
====================
Name: [Matt]
Date: [05.02.2026]

I've completed all 5 tutorials and application checklists.

Looking across all my checklists, these are the 2 most important issues 
to address in Week 2:


ISSUE 1 (Most Important)
-------------------------
Brief description: [There are impossible values e.g. more eggs hatched than were laid in 1 mosquito]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [TUTORIAL 5: NUMERIC & CROSS-VARIABLE CONSISTENCY]

Which variable(s) affected: [eggs_hatched, body_mass_mg]

Why this is important to fix: [Because its biologically impossible to be a negative mass and to hatch more eggs than were laid]

What I plan to do: [Remove the impossible values]



ISSUE 2 (Second Most Important)
--------------------------------
Brief description: [There are missing values in multiple variables]

Which tutorial provides the solution: [TUTORIAL 3: CHECKING MISSING DATA PATTERNS]

Which variable(s) affected: [eggs_hatched, eggs_laid, body_mass_mg]

Why this is important to fix: [Because with missing values some varaibles can be misrepresented in statistical analyses and mislead peoplpe]

What I plan to do: [remove the missing data points]



OTHER ISSUES I NOTICED (but won't fix in Week 2)
-------------------------------------------------
- [Issue 3 - filtering spelling mistakes such as in the collector variable]
- [Issue 4 - Fixing site variable inconsistencies such as Site-A site a and Site_A]
- [Issue 5 - Filtering site to be uniformly upper or lower case]


QUESTIONS TO DISCUSS IN WEEK 2
-------------------------------
Things I'm still unsure about:

1. How to determine what to do with NA values

2. How to determine what to do with impossible values

3.
